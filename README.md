# C-Portfolio
- Item Tracking program Written in C++


Project Summary and Problem Solving:

The project involves tracking and analyzing the frequency of purchased items. The goal is to read input data from a file, store the frequency of each item, and provide various options for users to analyze and visualize the data.


The code effectively uses a map to store item frequencies.
The program provides a user-friendly menu for interacting with the data.

Areas for Code Enhancement:

Input validation should be added to handle potential errors or malicious inputs.
The code currently reads the entire input file into memory. For large datasets, a streaming approach or memory optimization could be implemented.
Flexibility:
File names are hard-coded. Making these configurable or allowing users to input file names would enhance flexibility.

Challenging Pieces and Solutions:

Managing user input and ensuring the program remains robust against unexpected inputs required careful validation and error handling.
Implementing file reading and writing logic, especially error handling during file operations, was challenging.
Utilized C++ standard libraries for file handling, map data structure, and user input.
Online resources, were valuable for troubleshooting and learning.

Transferable Skills:

File Handling:
Enhanced skills in reading from and writing to files.
Data Structures:
Strengthened understanding and application of maps for data storage.
User Interaction:
Gained experience in creating a user-friendly menu system.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:

Descriptive variable and function names enhance code readability.
Code is organized into functions, improving maintainability.
Adequate comments clarify code functionality for future developers.
While the current code is suitable for its purpose, consideration for scalability could be beneficial for handling larger datasets or additional features.
